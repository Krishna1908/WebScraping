          Topic - Social Environmental Problems (faced by home services industry[]){
              
             First one a company named homejoy was shut down its doors due to some of the reasons mentioned below
            -its Struggled to create a reliable service
            -experienced last minute cancellation
            -they were unable to figure out how to deliver a consistently high quality service
            -It was a persistent struggle to retain high-quality cleaners.
            -The company refrained from enforcing a dress code or uniform; they did not develop a list of tasks that a cleaner needed to complete.
            -Homejoy’s general approach to maintaining quality was to try out cleaners for a period and then boot them off the platform if they didn’t work out.
            -Frequent issues included a lack of reliability, such as last minute cancellations, or too little availability. (Homejoy encouraged, but did not mandate, a minimum of 30 hours per week.) 
            -Homejoy’s only recourse against this threat, known as disintermediation, was to stop working with cleaners who attempted to recruit customers.
            - But it wasn’t always clear whether cleaners were seeking out independent relationships. 
            -Only late in the game did Homejoy attempt to make it easier for customers to request the same cleaner, which could have alleviated the problem or nipped it in the bud
             Customer Safety:
             - On the customer side, it requires a level of trust to allow a stranger into your home, often unaccompanied,
               for several hours. For those who are willing to take the risk, every home is different and each customer will 
               have a varied set of expectations.

           Challenges Faced :
           Since it is an unorganized service industry, it is fraught with challenges like building an efficient supply and demand channel, reaching the right customer on time,
           and hiring, training, and monitoring service professionals. 
           Since there are no clear price points or estimates dards of delivery, standardizing services, ensuring transparency of prices, 
           delivering a quality service, ensuring trustworthiness of a service provider, and maintaining quality check on a large scale are some major challenges these market players face.
           The shutting down of on-demand cleaning company Homejoy in US over class action suit by its service providers 
           highlights the vulnerability of all such on-demand startups which provide services through contractual workers and not company employed people.

          - focussing on the quality of service providers.
          - rder to make their platforms and apps more user friendly
